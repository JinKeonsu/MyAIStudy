Why are you in a bad mood?
Where did you put my book?
Isn't it on the bookshelf?
No, the bookshelf is full of your books.
Then, you should look in your room.
Look, it's right next to your toolbox.

[0501]
Guus! Can you call my boss and tell him I can't go to work today?
What's wrong?
I got a bad cold.
Why don't you go to see a doctor?
I think I should. I've been stuck with this cold for a week now.
Let me make you a cup of hot tea.
Thanks.

Hello.
Sam, can you come and get me?
Where are you?
My car went into a mud puddle and I have a flat tire.
I wish I could. But my car is in the body shop.
Well, I'd better take a bus then.

Hi, Amy! How about going out to dinner?
Well, I got to go my cousin's house by 9 o'clock. It's on South Street.
I heard that there is a nice restaurant near that Street. I can meet you there after 9 if you want.
Sure, I can drop around and have a good dinner then.
That's good. I'll call you.

Hey, are you going camping?
Yes, I'm going to lie on the beach sun bathing. Jealous, huh?
What are you taking in your pack?
I bought some peaches, grapes, tomatoes and pears.
You must be a real pig.

Did you take father's new camera?
Yes, I was only going to borrow it for a few hours.
You'd better return it soon. He is in a bad mood.
Maybe I should wait till he cools down.
What do you mean?
He'll hit the ceiling if he finds out I just broke the camera.

[1101]
Would you care for some beer dear?
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
Do you want to beer?
Sure, bring me some.
Maybe I didn't make myself clear. I wanted to go out for a drink.
Why can't we stay home and drink?
Well, the atmosphere isn't right.
Okay, you win. Let's go.

What movie did you see last night, Jane?
We saw a new version of King-Kong.
A new one? I'm a big fan of King-Kong. What was it about this time?
A plane carrying a famous singer crashed in the jungle of Congo.
Oh, I know what happens next. She starts to run for help but the sun is so hot that the poor thing falls down.
That's right.
