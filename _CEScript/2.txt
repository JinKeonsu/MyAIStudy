Where are you from Bob?
I'm from Denmark.
What did you do in Denmark?
I raised milk cows but I quit my job.

I got tired of getting up at daybreak.

Why are you so happy Brad?
Because I'm going to Japan next Wednesday.
Now I know why you are so excited.
By the way, Sandy! Can you lend me your camera?
Sure. Just don't forget to send me something nice from Japan.
Sure. I will send you a letter when I get there.

Ken, can you do me a big favor?
Well, it depends on what it is.
Can you give me a lift home?
Sure, what time are you getting off?
I'm ready now.
Well, everything is all set then let's go.

Why are you in a bad mood?
Where did you put my book?
Isn't it on the bookshelf?
No, the bookshelf is full of your books.
Then, you should look in your room.
Look, it's right next to your toolbox.
