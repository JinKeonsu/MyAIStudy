At that time, I was at midtown Manhattan on the 27th floor of a building facing south.
I saw a bowing 767 flying low down the center of the island Manhattan.
About 20 blocks north of the World Trade Center.
I saw the plane swerve to the left and fly directly into the north side of the South Tower.
It was the first plane.

When we were driving into town, there was an emergency exit.
We were trying to get out of the exit for the Memorial Bridge.
From the left hand side, a plane came in.
It was coming too fast, too low.
And then we saw it go down below the side of the street.
After that we saw the fire broke out.

How long will you stay in Korea?
I plan on staying for a year.
What will you be doing?
I want to learn Korean language.
I'm sure you'll catch on quickly.
Thank you. I hope so.

[0201] 5:19
Hey Randy, do you want to play some catch?
No, I can't. I'm doing my homework.
Dear Molly.
Hey, get out of here. I don't want you reading my homework.
Doesn't look like homework to me.
When I think of kissing you my heart beats like a symphony.
Hmm, hmm. It's for music class.
Oh, yeah. Then who's Molly?
Well. That shows how much you know. Molly is a musical instrument.
You know what I think. I think you got a new girl friend. Who is she?

[0202] 15:00
I don't know what she looks like. We've been sending love letters back and forth through the singles bulletin board on the computer.
So, when are you gonna meet her?
Never. She is 25.
No way. Why would a 25 years old girl be interested in you?
Because she thinks I'm a 32 years old dermatologist(피부과의사).
And uh... Where did she get that idea?
That's what I told her. I also told her I'm 6'4" and drive a Ferrari.
Wait till she finds out you are 4'6" and paddle a swing.
Well, that's the beauty of it. She never gonna find out. She lives in Saint Louis.

That guy just made a pass at me.
What did he say?
He said I have a nice figure.
What else did he do?
He gave me a wink.

[0301] 6:20
Mom, do we have any style reform balls?
No.
Just make up some of your meat balls.
Very funny. Hahaha. Sorry, Mark. The closest thing I got to style reform are these rice cakes.
I have to make spheres. I'm making the solar system for my science project.
Science project? You know I helped Randy with that volcano.
He got a C.
Jim! I think that Mark is smart enough to handle his project by himself.
Jill! I think it will be a lot more fun if we did it together.
I don't want to you taking it over.

[0302] 15:01
Mark is never gonna learn anything if he doesn't do his own work.
That's right Dad.
You stay out of this. It's between your mother and me.
Jim!
Okay. I'll just watch. I'll guide him. What have you got plan for that solar system?
Well, my plan was to hang a bunch of style reform balls on wires.
We can't just hang on the wires. First, we gotta get the right proportions for the planets. Oh, they gotta be the right distance from the sun. That is perfect, there.
Dad. I thought you're just gonna watch.
I am. I'm just telling you what I want to see.

[0303] 20:57
What's Jonny doing today?
I don't know.
We should give him a ring.
He is probably not home.

[0401] 5:23
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Molly.
Good Golly, this is Molly.
And who are you?
I'm Tim's wife, Jill.
Who's Tim?
The man you are holding hands with.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were Randy.
We have a 12 years old boy named Randy.
12? No, the Randy Taylor I've been corresponding with over the computer is a dermatologist.
Honey! Has Randy been skipping 6 grade and going to medical school again?
Are you sure you have the right house?
Yes, I even sent him software to this address.

[0402] 15:26
Why don't you come in? I think I may know what's going on here. What else did this Randy Taylor tell you about himself?
Just that he has two annoying brothers, his mother can't cook and he has an accident-prone father.
I'm glad I'm not in that family.
Jim, we are that family.
Oh, I can't believe. I have been corresponding with a 12 years old.
Well, he is very mature for his age.
Yeah. You are not kidding. His letters were very romantic and funny. The only strange thing was his up-session with Sears.
What's wrong with that? (@)
--- ???

[0501] 6:36
Hi.
Hi, can I help you?
I'm looking for Randy Taylor.
There is no Randy Taylor here.
And who are you?
A kid.
Strange. Dr. Taylor gotta be here because I just sent something to him to this address.
He moved out yesterday, we moved in today. Bye!
I don't see any moving boxes.
Well, we are a circus family. We unpack fast.
Did Dr. Taylor leave a forwarding address?
No, but he mention joining the Peace Corps in China.

[0502] 15:20
Hi, Randy. I'm back.
Randy?
She means Andy. I'm Andy, hi.
Hi, who's this?
I'm Molly Radon, I'm looking for Randy Taylor.
Well, this is Randy Taylor.
Randy, Andy, Candy, Sandy. I answer to anything.
Now, this is really weird. Because I've been getting love letters from a Randy Taylor. But, he is much older than you. He said he loves me almost as much as his ---???   iron scroll saw
Wait a minute. ---? I think I know what's going on here.
You do?

[0503] 21:43
Where are you going?
I'm going to the sauna.
Why?
I'm going to get some R and R. --> Rest and Relaxation
Hurry back!
I wouldn't be long.
