I was on the 27th floor of a building facing south.
I saw the plane swerve to the left.
It was the first plane.

(Script)
At that time, I was at midtown Manhattan on the 27th floor of a building facing south.
I saw a Boeing 767 flying low down the center of the island of Manhattan.
About 20 blocks north of the World Trade Center.
I saw the plane swerve to the left and fly directly into the north side of the South Tower.
It was the first plane.

[0102]
We were driving into town.
We were trying to get out of the exit.
It was coming too fast, too low.

(Script)
When we were driving into town, there was an emergency exit.
We were trying to get out of the exit for the Memorial Bridge.
From the left hand side, a plane came in.
It was coming too fast, too low.
And then we saw it go down below the side of the street.
After that we saw the fire broke out.

How long will you stay in Korea?
I plan on staying for a year.
What will you be doing?
I want to learn Korean language.
I'm sure you'll catch on quickly.
Thank you. I hope so.


[0201]
Get out of here.
My heart beats like a symphony.
That shows how much you know.
You know what I think?

(Script)
Hey Randy, do you want to play some catch?
I can't. I'm doing my homework.
Dear Molly.
Hey, get out of here. I don't want you to read my homework.
Doesn't look like homework to me. When I think of kissing you my heart beats like a symphony.
Hmm, hmm. It's for music class.
Oh, yeah. Then who's Molly?
Well. That shows how much you know. Molly is a musical instrument.
You know what I think? I think you got a new girl friend. Who is she?

[0202]
I don't know what she looks like.
When are you gonna meet her?
Where did she get that idea?
That's the beauty of it.

(Script)
I don't know what she looks like. We've been sending love letters back and forth through the singles bulletin board on the computer.
So, when are you gonna meet her?
Never. She is 25.
No way. Why would a 25 years old girl be interested in you?
Because she thinks I'm a 32 years old dermatologist(피부과의사).
And uh... Where did she get that idea?
That's what I told her. I also told her I'm 6'4" and drive a Ferrari.
Wait till she finds out you are 4'6" and paddle a swing.
Well, that's the beauty of it. She's never gonna find out. She lives in St. Louis.

That guy just made a pass at me.
What did he say?
He said I have a nice figure.
What else did he do?
He gave me a wink.


[0301]
He got a C.
Mark is smart enough to handle his project by himself.
It will be a lot more fun.
I don't want you taking it over.

(Script)
Mom, do we have any style reform balls?
No.
Just make up some of your meat balls.
Very funny. Hahaha. Sorry, Mark. The closest thing I got to style reform are these rice cakes.
I have to make spheres. I'm making the solar system for my science project.
Science project? You know I helped Randy with that volcano.
He got a C.
Tim! I think that Mark is smart enough to handle his project by himself.
Jill! I think it will be a lot more fun if we did it together.
I don't want you taking it over.

[0302]
He doesn't do his own work.
You stay out of this.
It's between your mother and me.
That is perfect.

(Script)
Mark is never gonna learn anything if he doesn't do his own work.
That's right Dad.
You stay out of this. It's between your mother and me.
Tim!
Okay. I'll just watch. I'll guide him. What have you got plan for that solar system?
Well, my plan was to hang a bunch of style reform balls on wires.
We can't just hang on the wires. First, we gotta get the right proportions for the planets. Oh, they gotta be the right distance from the sun. That is perfect. There!
Dad. I thought you're just gonna watch.
I am. I'm just telling you what I want to see.

What's Jonny doing today?
I don't know.
We should give him a ring. 그에게 전화를 해야할까봐.
He is probably not home.


[0401]
We have a 12-year-old boy named Randy.
Has Randy been skipping sixth grade?
Are you sure you have the right house?

(Script - At the door)
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Molly.
Good Golly, this is Molly.
And who are you?
I'm Tim's wife, Jill.
Who's Tim?
The man you are holding hands with.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were Randy.
We have a 12-year-old boy named Randy.
12? No, the Randy Taylor I've been corresponding with over the computer is a dermatologist.
Honey! Has Randy been skipping sixth grade and going to medical school again?
Are you sure you have the right house?
Yes, I even sent him software to this address.

[0402]
Why don't you come in? 들어오세요.
He is very mature for his age. 그는 나이에 비해 성숙해요.
You are not kidding. 맞아요. 그래요.
The only really strange thing was his obsession with Sears. 유일하게 이상한 점은 시어스에 유별나다는 것이었어요.

(Script - At the door)
Why don't you come in? I think I may know what's going on here. What else did this Randy Taylor tell you about himself?
Just that he has two annoying brothers, his mother can't cook and he has an accident-prone father.
I'm glad I'm not in that family.
Tim, we are that family.
Oh, I can't believe I've been corresponding with a 12-year-old.
Well, he is very mature for his age.
Yeah. You are not kidding. His letters were very romantic. And funny. The only really strange thing was his obsession with Sears.
There's nothing wrong with that.
You know he said my wit was "as sharp as a radial arm saw" ... ???


[0501]
I'm looking for Randy Taylor.
He moved out yesterday and we moved in today.
We unpack fast.
Did Dr. Taylor leave a forwarding address?

(Script - Randy meets Molly)
Hi.
Hi, can I help you?
I'm looking for Randy Taylor.
There is no Randy Taylor here.
And who are you?
A kid.
Strange. Dr. Taylor gotta be here because I just sent something to him to this address.
He moved out yesterday and we moved in today. Bye!
I don't see any moving boxes.
Well, we are a circus family. We unpack fast.
Did Dr. Taylor leave a forwarding address?
No, but he mention joining the Peace Corps in China.

[0502]
I'm back.
This is really weird.
He is much older than you.
I think I know what's going on here.

(Script - Randy meets Molly)
Hi, Randy. I'm back.
Randy?
She means Andy. I'm Andy, hi.
Hi, who's this?
I'm Molly Radon. I'm looking for Randy Taylor.
Well, this is Randy Taylor.
Randy, Andy, Candy, Sandy. I answer to anything.
Now, this is really weird. Because I've been getting love letters from a Randy Taylor. But, he is much older than you. He said he loves me almost as much as his cast-iron scroll saw
Wait a minute. Cast-iron scroll saw? I think I know what's going on here.
You do?

[0503]
(Slang)
Where are you going?
I'm going to the sauna.
Why?
I'm going to get some R and R. --> Rest and Relaxation
Hurry back!
I wouldn't be long.

I should have seen this coming. I should've seen this coming.
You two-timing tool twit.
What did I do?
You don't have to play dumb.

(Script - Randy in trouble)
My husband always used to write about a cast-iron scroll saw in all of his love letters to me. He must be writing you love letters and then just signing our son's name. I should have seen this coming when he started hating my bras.
Mom, you don't understand.
Hi, honey!
Don't "Hi, honey" me. You two-timing tool twit.
What did I do?
You don't have to play dumb. Your wife knows all about us.
Us?
You can just take your tools and move in with Molly.
No, Mom.

[0602]
Mind your own business. 참견마세요(네 일이나 신경써라)
I was just trying to have a little fun. 전 그냥 장난삼아 한거에요.
The jig's up. 장난은 끝났다
You guys set me up. 당신들이 날 골탕 먹인거에요.

(Script - Randy )
No, Mom.
Who's Molly?
I am! Now kiss me like you said you would in your letter.
I don't know what I said, but what the heck!
Dad, stop! Don't kiss her!
Mind your own business.
Look, I'm the one who wrote the letter. I used your old love letters. I was just trying to have a little fun.
Are you having a little fun now?
Not particularly.
The jig's up, Dr. Taylor.
You guys set me up! You knew about this all along.
That's right, Dr.
I can't believe I was outsmarted by my parents.

[0603]
How much do I owe you?
Your total is 10 dollars.
Can I charge it?
I'm sorry but we don't accept credit card.
Then, can you break a 100?
Of course.
