At that time, I was at midtown Manhattan on the 27th floor of a building facing south.
I saw a bowing 767 flying low down the center of the island Manhattan.
About 20 blocks north of the World Trade Center.
I saw the plane swerve to the left and fly directly into the north side of the South Tower.
It was the first plane.

When we were driving into town, there was an emergency exit.
We were trying to get out of the exit for the Memorial Bridge.
From the left hand side, a plane came in.
It was coming too fast, too low.
And then we saw it go down below the side of the street.
After that we saw the fire broke out.

How long will you stay in Korea?
I plan on staying for a year.
What will you be doing?
I want to learn Korean language.
I'm sure you'll catch on quickly.
Thank you. I hope so.

Hey Randy, do you want to play some catch?
No, I can't. I'm doing my homework.
Dear Molly.
Hey, get out of here. I don't want you reading my homework.
Doesn't look like homework to me.
When I think of kissing you my heart beats like a symphony.
Hmm, hmm. It's for music class.
Oh, yeah. Then who's Molly?
Well. That shows how much you know. Molly is a musical instrument.
You know what I think. I think you got a new girl friend. Who is she?

I don't know what she looks like. We've been sending love letters back and forth through the singles bulletin board on the computer.
So, when are you gonna meet her?
Never. She is 25.
No way. Why would a 25 years old girl be interested in you?
Because she thinks I'm a 32 years old dermatologist(피부과의사).
And uh... Where did she get that idea?
That's what I told her. I also told her I'm 6'4" and drive a Ferrari.
Wait till she finds out you are 4'6" and paddle a swing.
Well, that's the beauty of it. She never gonna find out. She lives in Saint Louis.

That guy just made a pass at me.
What did he say?
He said I have a nice figure.
What else did he do?
He gave me a wink.
