Oh, good afternoon!
Good afternoon!
We haven't met before. Have we? My name is Thomas Davis and I'm the new export sales manager.
Oh, yes. I've heard a lot about you. I'm Cindy Jones, Mr. Brown's secretary. Nice to meet you.
Pleased to meet you too. Is Mr. Brown at the office?
Oh, yes. I'll let her know you are here right now. Please have a sit and wait for a moment.
Okay, thank you.
