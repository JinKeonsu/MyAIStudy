A: May I have your attention please? It's time to start everyone. Now, the first item on the agenda is the discussion of the manager's proposal on flexible working hours. Well, Ms. Jones, would you like to start first?
B: Let me begin by saying that most peoples in our department are satisfied with the present system. We think a change would be dangerous.
C: I'm sorry but I'm not quite with you. I feel that by offering flexible working hours lead the management will be showing our employees that we are willing to work with them not against them.
D: Personally, I am in favor of the plan. But, I think we'd better wait for more details. And then, we should bring the matter to a vote.
A: Are there any other points relating to this proposal? No? Then, let's move on to the next item on the agenda.
