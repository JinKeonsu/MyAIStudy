Oh, good afternoon!
Good afternoon!
We haven't met before. Have we? My name is Thomas Davis and I'm the new export sales manager.
Oh, yes. I've heard a lot about you. I'm Cindy Jones, Mr. Brown's secretary. Nice to meet you.
Pleased to meet you too. Is Mr. Brown at the office?
Oh, yes. I'll let her know you are here right now. Please have a sit and wait for a moment.
Okay, thank you.

Neilson publishing company, Cindy Jones speaking.
Hello, this is Thomas Davis.
Hello, Mr. Davis. How are you?
Fine thanks. I'm phoning about the fax you sent me yesterday.
Ah, good. I was just about to call you about that.
I wish to order about 2000 of new books. Could you let me know what the discount rate is like for an order of 100 more?
We can offer you a 40% discount. The rate can only be applied to international trade account. If you want to know about the price and payment terms in detail, you'd better contact our account manager Karen.
I see. Thank you very much. It's nice talking you. Good bye!
Bye, Mr. Davis!

Account department, Cindy Jones speaking.
Hello, this is James Jung with Star company in Korea.
Hi, Mr. Jung! I was told to expect your call from our international sales manager. How can I help you?
Could you tell me about your payment terms for your new books?
Yes, of course. New accounts are subject to a pre-payment or letter of credit refund first order. Payment must be made by an irrevocable letter of credit confirmed on TD Bank which must be valid for 120 days from the date of your order.
One moment please. Let me just make a note of that.
You don't have to do that. I'll send you more information about our payment, free and return policies. I'll fax it today.
That would be very helpful. Thank you very much.
You're very welcome. Bye, Mr. Davis!
Bye, Ms. Jones!
