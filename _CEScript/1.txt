I like action movies more than horror movies.
Same here. What time do you want to meet?
How about 5 o'clock?
Fine. See you then.

[1302]
How was the movie?
To be honest with you, it was boring. It was a little different from what I expected. How about you?
I agree. It wasn't interesting at all.
Right. By the way, who is your favorite movie star?
My favorite movie star is Tom Cruise. I've seen all of his movies. I'm really a big fan of his.

[1401]
Do you want me to take a picture of you?
Yes, please.
How does this camera work?
Just push the button.
I see. Say Kim-chi and smile.
Thanks.
You're welcome. Have a good trip.

[1402]
Hi Sandy. How was your trip?
It was fantastic.
Did you take a lot of pictures?
Sure, I've already developed them. I'll show you the pictures.

How about trying another dish today?
Wonderful! Let's go.

[1502]
Was the meal okay?
Sure, thank you for treating me. Hmm... By the way, if it's not too much could you drop me off in front of my house?

Sure, I need to make a deposit today too.
Great! I'm going to open a bank account.

[1601]
Where is the shop selling washing-machine?
Well, I have no idea. Let's ask a clerk at the information desk.
Okay, but where is the information desk?
Hmm... Let me see. Look, there it is.
Let's go.
Excuse me, where is the appliance shop?
Go straight and turn left at the corner you can find it on your right-hand side.
Thank you.

[1602]
Does this shop sell washing-machine?
Yes, this is the newest model.
Can you show me how it works?
Okay. Here are some dirty shirts. You put them in the machine and shut the door then you push this button. ... Ah, it's finished now.
But, the shirts have shrunk terribly.
Clothes usually shrink if washed.
Well, I don't think so.
