[Ch. 1]
John! I can't believe it's you.
Helen! We haven't seen each other in ages.
So, how are things with you?
I've been traveling a lot this past year.
That sounds exciting!
Not really. I missed my home.
I understand you. Anyway I gotta go. Let's get together soon.

Hi Susan, I haven't seen you in ages.
Yes, it's been such a long time Bob.
So, what have you been doing?
Well, right after I graduated, I got a job at a bank. Now I'm the manager of the bank.
Oh really? You really have made something of yourself.
What about you?
I just got a job in NewYork.

<slang>
Wow, time flies. It's already 12 midnight.
I know. You'd better crash my place tonight.
I think I'm okay the drive.
No, you drank too much. You should sleep over my place.

[Ch. 2]
What are we going to do this weekend?
I don't know about you. But I have to run errands for my mother.
No, we should do something special this weekend.
I can't. I've already promised my mom that I'll help her.

Wow. You are home early. Do you want to catch a movie tonight?
I can't. I have errands to run.
Like what?
First I have to wash my car then I have to pick up my suit after that ...
That's enough. We won't go to a movie.

<slang>
Well, are you ready for the exam?
No, I need to the books tonight.
Would you like to study together?
That would be great.
Then can you meet me?
How about 7 o'clock?
Great. Let's meet at the library.

[Ch. 3]
Jenny, I owe you an apology.
What for?
I heard about your surgery but didn't have a chance to visit you.
Don't worry about it.
How do you feel now?
I'm feeling much better, thanks.
Take care of yourself.

You stood me up.
I'm really sorry. I owe you an apology.
You owe me an explanation.
You won't believe what happened.
Try me.
I was pulled over for speeding and on top of that I got a scratch on my car. So I was late.

<slang>
Let's go out for pizza.
I can't.
Why not?
I'm broke.
It's okay, I have money.

[Ch. 4]
Mom I can't get up.
What's wrong?
I don't feel well.
Let me see. You have a fever. Maybe I should call a doctor.
That won't do any good. I might as well stay home and rest.

Do you want to go out to eat?
No, I had dinner already.
How about dancing?
No, I'm too tired. Let's think of something we can do together.
Forget it. Let's just stay home.

<slang>
Are you going to watch TV all day?
It's Sunday and all the good shows are on. There is nothing else I need to do anyway.
But it's such a nice day. You are such a couch-potato. Let's go roller-blading at the beach.

[Ch. 5]
Do you know Gina is very sick?
I saw her last night.
Oh really? How come?
I can't say. She asked me keep quiet about it.
You can tell me her secret safe with me.
She found another job.

Can you keep a secret?
You can trust me. What's the secret?
I took out all my college savings and bought a motorcycle.
Will you let me take for a ride?
Yes, if you don't let on me.
Your secret (is) safe with me.

<slang>
Did he send you flowers on valentines-day?
Yes, he did. But I threw them away because I'm allergic to flowers.
He doesn't know?
Apparently not. Let's keep the conversation between you and me.

[Ch. 6]
Are you ready to go home?
No, I still have some work to do.
Let's call it a day.
OK, 1 minute. Let me grab my things.
OK, we'd better go before the boss gives us more work.
OK, I'm all set. Let's go.

How's your day going?
Oh, it's been one of those days.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm just under a lot of stress.
Don't worry, things will get better.
Thanks for listening.
Why don't you call it a day?
I can't. I have an important meeting tomorrow and I need to get ready for it.

<slang>
I'm tired of work.
Me too. But we have a holiday coming up soon.
I know. Can we call it a day?
Let's take it out for a little while.
You are right.
Let's get back to work.
